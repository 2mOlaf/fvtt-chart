# Foundry VTT

[Foundry VTT](http://foundryvtt.com/) is a standalone application built for experiencing multiplayer tabletop RPGs using a feature-rich and modern self-hosted application where your players connect directly through the browser.
## Introduction

This chart creates a single Foundry VTT Pod, plus Services for the Foundry VTT server.

## Prerequisites

- 512 MB of RAM
- Kubernetes 1.4+ with Beta APIs enabled
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`, run:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release ./incubator/foundry-vtt
```

This command deploys a Foundry VTT dedicated server with sensible defaults.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm uninstall my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Refer to [values.yaml](values.yaml) for the full run-down on defaults. These are a mixture of Kubernetes and Foundry VTT-related directives that map to environment variables in the [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/) Docker image.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release \
    --set foundryvtt.port=30000 \
    ./incubator/foundry-vtt
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml ./incubator/foundry-vtt
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Persistence

The [Foundry VTT Docker](https://github.com/hugoprudente/foundryvtt-docker) image needs to be built and published to private registry, stores the saved games and mods under /data.

By default a PersistentVolumeClaim is created and mounted for saves but not mods. In order to disable this functionality

you can change the values.yaml to disable persistence under the sub-sections under `persistence`.

> *"An emptyDir volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a Node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. When a Pod is removed from a node for any reason, the data in the emptyDir is deleted forever."*

## TLS with Cert Manager

### Install the CustomResourceDefinition resources separately
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack/cert-manager/release-0.12/deploy/manifests/00-crds.yaml
```

> **Important:**
> If you are running Kubernetes v1.15 or below, you will need to add the `--validate=false flag to your kubectl apply command above else you will receive a validation error relating to the x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields field in cert-managerâ€™s CustomResourceDefinition resources. This is a benign error and occurs due to the way kubectl performs resource validation.

### Create the namespace for cert-manager
```
kubectl create namespace cert-manager
```

### Add the Jetstack Helm repository
```
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
```

### Update your local Helm chart repository cache
```
helm repo update
```

### Install the cert-manager Helm chart
```
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --version v0.12.0
```

kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager
```
